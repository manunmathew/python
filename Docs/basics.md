# Python Basics

## Print Function
- `print()`: Function to print the output to the console.
- `type()`: Function to print the type of the variable
- `exit()`: Function to exit the program 

## Comments
- `#`: Used for single-line comments.
- `Ctrl + /`: Shortcut to comment selected lines.

## Data Types

### 1. Text Data Type
- **String**: A collection of characters represented using single quotes or double quotes.

### 2. Numeric Data Type
- **Integer**: Numbers without decimal points.
- **Float**: Numbers with decimal points.
- **Complex**: Numbers in the format `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.

### 3. Sequential Data Type
- **List**:
  - Collection of elements (can be called an array).
  - Ordered collection.
  - Can contain any data type.
  - Mutable (changeable).
  - Indexed (first index position is 0).
  - Defined by `[]`.

- **Tuple**:
  - Collection of elements similar to a list.
  - Ordered collection.
  - Indexed (first index position is 0).
  - Immutable (not changeable).
  - Defined by `()`.

### 4. Mapping Data Type
- **Dictionary**:
  - Collection of key-value pairs.
  - Not indexed.
  - Duplication of keys is not allowed.
  - Mutable.
  - Defined by `{}`.

### 5. Set Data Type
- **Set**:
  - Collection of unique elements.
  - Not indexed.
  - Duplication of elements is not allowed.
  - Unordered.
  - Defined by `{}`.

### 6. Boolean Data Type
- **Boolean**: Represents `True` or `False`.

## Variables
A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, variables in a Python program give data to the computer for processing.

### Rules for Python Variables
1. Variables start with a letter or underscore.
2. Cannot start with a number.
3. Can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`_`).
4. Case-sensitive (e.g., `AGE`, `age`, `Age` are three different variable names).
5. Keywords cannot be used as variables (e.g., `and`, `or`, `if`, `def`).
