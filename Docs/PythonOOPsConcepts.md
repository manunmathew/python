# Object-Oriented Programming
oops concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
## Python Class
A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created.

Function that defined inside class is known as member function or methods

Class Definition Syntax:

class ClassName:
   # Statement-1
   .

   # Statement-N

## Python Objects

## self in Python class

In object oriented programming self is reference to the current instance of the class. it is used to access variables and methods that belongs to the class. it allows the methods to access attributes and other methods on the same object

## Static (Class) Variables:
 A static variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined within the class but outside any methods.

## Dynamic (Instance) Variables:
A dynamic variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class. It is usually defined within methods,
