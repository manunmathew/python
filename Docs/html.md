# HTML Overview

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a **markup language** that provides a set of tags suitable for creating web pages. It is a scripting language, and the output of HTML documents can be viewed in a web browser. Some key characteristics of HTML include:

- **Tag-based system**: HTML uses tags to define elements within a document.
- **No errors generated**: Web browsers won't generate errors for incorrect HTML, although they may not display content as intended.

## What is Hypertext?

Hypertext is text that contains links (called hyperlinks) to other documents or pages, allowing users to navigate between content by clicking these links.

## What is Markup?

Markup refers to the use of tags to define the structure and presentation of content within a document. In HTML, markup is used to annotate text, images, and other elements so that they are structured correctly and rendered by the browser.

## Structure of HTML Documents

### 1. Head Section
The **head section** contains metadata and control information used by the browser, as well as the title of the document. This section includes elements such as:

- `<title>`: Specifies the title of the page (shown in the browser tab).
- `<meta>`: Provides metadata about the document (e.g., charset, author, description).

### 2. Body Section
The **body section** contains the main content that is displayed on the screen. This is where tags such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links are used to create the visible structure of the web page.

Example of a simple HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of content displayed on the page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
