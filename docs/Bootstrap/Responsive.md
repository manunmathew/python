# Bootstrap 5 Responsive Screen Sizes

Bootstrap 5 provides a powerful, flexible grid system and responsive utilities to adapt web layouts across various screen sizes. It includes six default breakpoints to handle different screen sizes.

## Screen Sizes and Breakpoints

| Breakpoint   | Class Prefix | Screen Width Range  |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Small (`sm`) | `.col-sm-`   | 576px to 767px     |
| Medium (`md`)| `.col-md-`   | 768px to 991px     |
| Large (`lg`) | `.col-lg-`   | ≥992px             |

These breakpoints are used to control the layout based on the screen size.

## Responsive Grid System

The grid system is based on 12 columns, with each screen size using a specific prefix (e.g., `col-sm`, `col-md`, `col-lg`). This allows for different layouts based on the screen width.

### Example: Responsive Columns

Below is an example of a responsive layout that changes based on the screen size.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
      <!-- Content for Column 1 -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
      <!-- Content for Column 2 -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-4">
      <!-- Content for Column 3 -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**
- **Small Screens (`576px - 767px`)**: Each column takes the full width (`col-sm-12`).
- **Medium Screens (`768px - 991px`)**: Each row has two columns side by side (`col-md-6`).
- **Large Screens (`≥992px`)**: Each row has three columns (`col-lg-4`).

## Responsive Utilities

### Display Classes

Bootstrap includes classes to show or hide elements based on screen size. Use `d-*` classes to control visibility:

```html
<div class="d-none d-sm-block d-md-none">Visible only on small screens</div>
<div class="d-md-block d-lg-none">Visible only on medium screens</div>
<div class="d-lg-block">Visible on large screens and above</div>
```

### Margin and Padding

Responsive margins and padding adjust spacing based on screen size:

```html
<div class="p-2 p-md-4">Padding increases on medium and larger screens</div>
<div class="m-1 m-lg-3">Margin increases on large screens and up</div>
```

---

## Responsive Text Alignment

Text alignment can be adjusted for different screen sizes:

```html
<p class="text-start text-md-center text-lg-end">Aligned differently for each screen size</p>
```
